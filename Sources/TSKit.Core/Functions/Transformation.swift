/// Performs `transformation` on specified `object` using `inout` closure.
///
/// This method  is used to modify existing immutable `object` by creating a copy of it and applying
/// provided `transformation`. It is designed to operate on objects of **value types**,
/// to reduce repeatitions of the same code costruct.
/// **Reference types** are supported, however `transform` gives no benefits in these cases,
/// as you can directly modify immutable **reference type** variables.
/// - Parameter object: An object to which `transformation` will be applied.
/// - Parameter transformation: `inout` closure that performs transformation of the `object`.
/// - Note: When passing reference type objects to this method
///         it will apply transformation to and will return the same object.
/// - Returns: Mutated object after `transformation`.
